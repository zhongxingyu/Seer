  * The Ibis abstraction for data to be read.
  * A <code>ReadMessage</code> is obtained from a
  * {@link ibis.ipl.ReceivePort receiveport}, either
  * by means of an upcall, or by means of an explicit receive, which is
  * accomplished by call to {@link ibis.ipl.ReceivePort#receive() receive}.
  * A {@link ibis.ipl.ReceivePort receiveport} can be configured to generate
  * upcalls or to support blocking receive, but NOT both!
  * At most one <code>ReadMessage</code> is alive at one time for a given
  * </code>ReceivePort</code>.
  * For all read methods in this class, the invariant is that the reads must
  * match the writes one by one. The only exception to this rule is that an
  * array written with any of the <code>writeArray</code> methods of
  * {@link WriteMessage} can be read by {@link #readObject}.
  * <strong>
  * In particular, an array written with
  * {@link WriteMessage#writeObject writeObject}
  * cannot be read with <code>readArray</code>, because
  * {@link WriteMessage#writeObject writeObject} does duplicate detection,
  * and may have written only a handle.
