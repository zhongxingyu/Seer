 /**
  * The {@code AsyncDataController} used to control the way the data is provided
  * by an {@link AsyncDataLink} and the state of providing the data.
  *
  * <h3>Controlling the data providing process</h3> Although {@code AsyncDataLink}
  * instances are assumed to be linked to a particular data, they may provide
  * that data in multiple steps by providing more and more accurate version of
  * the data. This can be controlled by the
  * {@link #controlData(Object) controlData} method. <P> Many times it may occur
  * that the requested data is no longer needed, in this case the {@link #cancel() cancel}
  * method can be called to stop providing anymore data. Note however, that
  * canceling a task is only a request and in the extreme case, implementations
  * of {@code AsyncDataLink} may completely ignore this request. However, it is
  * recommended for every implementations of
  * {@code AsyncDataLink} to stop providing data as soon as possible when
  * cancellation was request.
  *
  * <h3>Checking the state of the data providing process</h3> Sometimes it is
  * good to know what actually is the {@code AsyncDataLink} providing the data is
  * doing. This knowledge can be used for various purposes like visually
  * displaying the progress to the user or tracking the cause of bugs when a data
  * is never loaded (e.g.: due to a deadlock). For this purpose implementations
  * must provide this state through the
  * {@link #getDataState() getDataState} method. This state as a bare minimum
  * must provide a double value between 0.0 and 1.0 of the state of the current
  * progress.
  *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3> Implementations of this interface are required to be
 * safe to use by multiple threads concurrently.
  *
 * <h4>Synchronization transparency</h4> Implementations of this interface are
 * not required to be <I>synchronization transparent</I> except for the
  * {@link #getDataState() getDataState} method which must be implemented so that
  * its synchronization is invisible to users of this interface in terms of
  * correctness.

      * <P>
      * How exactly the data providing can be affected is entirely implementation

      *   control argument in general is expected to be safely sharable across
      *   multiple threads concurrently and to be a relatively lightweight
      *   object. That is, it is highly recommended that control arguments be
      *   simple immutable objects only containing a minimal number of hints.

      *   this exception if they find that the passed argument is inappropriate
