 /**
  * Manager that switches on and off some resource for a shared multiuser access.
  * The nature of actual resource should be defined in subclass of
  * {@link SessionManager}. Time period when resource is on is called "session".
  * Switch on operation (aka session creation) must be an atomic operation.
  * Switch off (aka session closing) may be lengthy asynchronous operation.
  * <p>
  * If no user needs it, manager switches the resource off. On the first demand
  * resource gets switched on (and new session gets created). After the last user
  * has released the resource, the session finishes either instantly or
  * some time later. In the latter case resource becomes temporary unavailable.
  * The manager does not operate resource in any other sense than switching it
  * on and off.
  * <p>
  * Every user first acquires the resource by calling {@link #connect()} method.
  * It gets ticket which points to the corresponding session. Method
  * {@link Ticket#dismiss()} must be called when resource is no more needed.
  * @param <SESSION> user class that represents a session; must
  *                  extend {@link SessionBase}
  * @param <EX> exception that is allowed to be thrown when resource is being switched
  *             on and the new session is starting; {@link RuntimeException}
  *             is a good default parameter value
