 /**
  * Defines a container for {@link BasicImageTransformations basic  image transformations}
  * and for the zoom to fit transformation. Client code may listen for changes
  * in a {@code BasicTransformationModel} by
  * {@link #addTransformationListener(TransformationListener) adding listeners}.
  * Therefore this class is suited to be used by <I>Swing</I> components.
  * <P>
  * Notice that when using the zoom to fit transformation, there are properties
  * which might cannot be fulfilled (such as zoom). In these cases the zoom to
  * fit should take precedence.
  *
  * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
  * Methods reading values from this model are safe to access from multiple
  * threads concurrently (even concurrently with writes). Updating the values
  * however may not be done concurrently, even if updating different properties
  * of the same {@code BasicTransformationModel} instance.
  *
  * <h4>Synchronization transparency</h4>
  * Methods of this class are not <I>synchronization transparent</I>. Note
  * therefore that you should avoid organizing access to instances of this class
  * using locks because methods of this class might invoke listeners (and you
  * should have little expectations on what listeners do). The best way to use
  * this class in a multi-thread environment is to use it from a dedicated
  * thread, or from a {@link org.jtrim.concurrent.TaskExecutor TaskExecutor}
  * which does not execute tasks concurrently. You may also use the
 * {@link org.jtrim.concurrent.TaskExecutors#inOrderExecutor(org.jtrim.concurrent.TaskExecutor) TaskExecutors.inOrderExecutor(TaskExecutor)}
  * method to create such an executor.
  * <P>
  * Note however, that this class was designed for <I>Swing</I> components and
  * if you are using this with one, you should only use this class on the
  * <I>AWT Event Dispatch Thread</I>.
