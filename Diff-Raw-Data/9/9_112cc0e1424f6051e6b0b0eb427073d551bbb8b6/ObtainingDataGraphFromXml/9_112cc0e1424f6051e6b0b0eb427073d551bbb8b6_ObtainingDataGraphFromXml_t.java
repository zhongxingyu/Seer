 /**
  * This sample program demonstrates a variety of methods available to obtain the root DataObject
  * contained within an xml representation of a DataGraph. This is currently a grey
  * area of the specification and this sample demonstrates spec compliant methods, as
  * well as utility methods that have been added to Tuscany to address issues within
  * the specification.
  * 
  * The following sample is from the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany"
  * target="_blank"> Apache Tuscany</a> project. It was written to help users
  * understand and experiment with SDO. It is based upon example code contained
  * within, and is meant for use with, and reference to the <a
  * href="http://osoa.org/download/attachments/36/Java-SDO-Spec-v2.1.0-FINAL.pdf?version=1"
  * target="_bank">SDO Specification</a>. This sample attempts to clarify aspects of
  * the the AccessDataObjectsUsingXPath example from the Examples section of the SDO
  * specification.<br>
  * <br>
  * To define the correct Types for each DataObject ( CompanyType, DepartmentType etc )
  * this sample relies upon
  * {@link org.apache.tuscany.samples.sdo.SdoSampleConstants#COMPANY_XSD} which is
  * provided in the resources directory of these samples. The xml file
  * {@link org.apache.tuscany.samples.sdo.SdoSampleConstants#COMPANY_DATAGRAPH_XML} is
  * used to load the DataGraph and is also located in this resources directory. <br>
  * <P>
  * <b>Usage:</b> <br>
  * This sample can easily be run from within Eclipse as a Java Application if tuscany or 
  * the sample-sdo project is imported into Eclipse as an existing project.
  * <br><br>
