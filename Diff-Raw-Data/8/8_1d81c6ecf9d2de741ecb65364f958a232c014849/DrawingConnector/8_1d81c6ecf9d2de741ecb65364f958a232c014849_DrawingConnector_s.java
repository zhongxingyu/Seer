 /**
  * A helper class for triple buffering when rendering to a {@code BufferedImage}.
  * <P>
  * This class might be useful in the following scenario: Assume that there is
  * a thread doing the actual rendering and it is rendering to a
  * {@code BufferedImage}. Once it finished rendering, it needs to publish the
  * result of the rendering some way. It may choose to simply submit the
  * {@code BufferedImage} to another thread to display the results and continue
  * the subsequent rendering task. However, to start the another rendering it
  * will need another {@code BufferedImage} to render to. If it creates a new
  * {@code BufferedImage}, it might cause a heavy load on the garbage collector
  * (since {@code BufferedImage} objects are heavy).
  * <P>
  * This class helps in the above mentioned scenario when the thread displaying
  * the image can cooperate with the thread doing the rendering. That is, this
  * class is intended to be used the following way:
  * <ol>
  *  <li>
  *   Once the renderer needs a {@code BufferedImage} to render to, it needs to
  *   call the {@link #getDrawingSurface(int) getDrawingSurface} method to
  *   retrieve a {@code BufferedImage}.
  *  </li>
  *   After rendering completes, the renderer thread must call the
  *   {@link #presentNewImage(BufferedImage, Object) presentNewImage} method to
  *   publish the result of the rendering and then notify in some way the
  *   displaying thread that a new rendering result is available. Then, the
  *   rendering thread may continue rendering again.
  *  <li>
  *   Once the displaying thread knows that a new rendering process has
  *   completed, it needs to call the {@link #copyMostRecentGraphics(Graphics2D, int, int) copyMostRecentGraphics}
  *   method to copy the result of the rendering to a {@code Graphics2D} object.
  *  </li>
  * </ol>
  * This class works by storing a reference to two {@code BufferedImage}
  * instances, one is the last result presented through the
  * {@code presentNewImage} and another one which is used to returned by the
  * {@code getDrawingSurface} method call. Notice that {@code presentNewImage}
  * method calls overwrite each other's result, so after the second invocation
  * the currently stored {@code BufferedImage} will be useless for the
  * {@code DrawingConnector}. This is the image which will be returned by the
  * {@code getDrawingSurface} method.
  * <P>
  * This class is allowed to be subclassed for the sole purpose of overriding
  * the {@code scaleToGraphics} method to provide a user defined implementation.
  *
  * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
  * Instances of this class are safe to be accessed from multiple threads
  * concurrently.
  *
  * <h4>Synchronization transparency</h4>
  * Methods of this class are not <I>synchronization transparent</I>.
  *
  * @param <ResultType> the type of the object which might be attached to a
  *   rendered {@code BufferedImage}
