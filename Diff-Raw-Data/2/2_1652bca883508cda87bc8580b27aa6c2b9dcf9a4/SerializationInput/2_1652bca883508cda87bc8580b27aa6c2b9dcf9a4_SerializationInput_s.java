  * The <code>SerializationInput</code> interface specifies which methods
  * must be implemented by any serialization input stream type. Some
  * of these methods may just throw an exception, depending on the
  * serialization type. For instance, the <code>readInt</code> method
  * of a "byte" serialization input stream will just throw an exception.
  * <p>
  * For all read methods in this interface, the invariant is that the reads
  * must match the writes one by one. The only exception to this rule is that an
  * array written with any of the <code>writeArray</code> methods can be
  * read by {@link #readObject}.
  * <strong>
  * In particular, an array written with
  * {@link SerializationOutput#writeObject writeObject}
  * cannot be read with <code>readArray</code>, because
  * {@link SerializationOutput#writeObject writeObject} does duplicate
  * detection, and may have written only a handle.
