 	    c. This Plugin, Modified Plugins, and derivative works may not
 	       be sold or released under any paid license without explicit

 	       Demigods Team.
 	
 	 2. You may make Modifications to this Plugin or a derivative of it,

 	    c. Any Distribution of a Modified Plugin or derivative requires
 	       express written consent from the Demigods Team.
 	
 	 3. Permission is hereby also granted to distribute programs which

 	 4. The Demigods Team reserves the right to change the terms of this
 	    Agreement at any time, although those changes are not retroactive
 	    to past releases, unless redefining the Demigods Team. Failure to
 	    receive notification of a change does not make those changes invalid.
 	    A current copy of this Agreement can be found included with the Plugin.
 	
 	 5. This Agreement will terminate automatically if you fail to comply
 	    with the limitations described herein. Upon termination, you must
 	    destroy all copies of this Plugin, the Software, and any
