 /**
  * SoundInfo identifies a sound (previously defined using The DefineSound class)
  * and controls how it is played.
  *
  * <p>
  * SoundInfo defines how the sound fades in and out, whether it is repeated as
  * well as specifying an envelope that provides a finer degree of control over
  * the levels at which the sound is played.
  * </p>
  *
  * <p>
  * The in and out point specify the sample number which marks the point in time
  * at which the sound stops increasing or starts decreasing in volume
  * respectively. Sounds are played by the Flash player at 44.1KHz so the sample
  * number also indicates the time when the total number of samples in the sound
  * is taken into account.
  * </p>
  *
  * <p>
  * Not all the attributes are required to play a sound. Only the identifier and
  * the mode is required. The other attributes are optional and may be added as a
  * greater degree of control is required. The inPoint and outPoint attributes
  * may be set to zero if the sound does not fade in or out respectively. The
  * loopCount may be set to zero if a sound is being stopped. The envelopes array
  * may be left empty if no envelope is defined for the sound. The class provides
  * different constructors to specify different sets of attributes.
  * </p>
