 /**
  * Defines a base class for <I>Swing</I> components drawn in the background.
  * <P>
  * This class relies on {@link AsyncRenderer} to do the background painting.
  * This {@code AsyncRenderer} must be set <I>before</I> the component is
  * actually rendered, preferably by passing it to the constructor. To provide
  * input for the {@code AsyncRenderer} call one of the {@code setRenderingArgs}
  * methods. It is also mandatory to call any of the {@code setRenderingArgs}
  * before the component is actually displayed (the preferred way is to call
  * {@code setRenderingArgs} from within the constructor of the implementation.
  * <P>
  * This component also provides various methods to check the progress of the
  * painting of this component. This might be used by implementations to
  * do addition paintings in case the rendering process takes too much time.
  * <P>
  * In case you want to set the rendering arguments ({@code setRenderingArgs})
  * lazily, you may do so in a {@link #addPrePaintListener(Runnable) pre-paint listener}.
  * <P>
  * The thread-safety property of this component is the same as with any other
  * <I>Swing</I> components. That is, instances of this class can be accessed
  * only from the AWT Event Dispatch Thread after made displayable.
