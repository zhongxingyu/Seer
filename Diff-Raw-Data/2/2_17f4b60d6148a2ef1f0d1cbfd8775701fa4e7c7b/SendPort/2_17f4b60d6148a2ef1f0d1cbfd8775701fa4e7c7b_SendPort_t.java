 /**
 * Initiates and maintains connections to one or more receive ports.
  *
  * When creating a sendport, it is possible to pass a
  * {@link SendPortDisconnectUpcall} object.
  * When a connection is lost for some reason, the 
  * {@link SendPortDisconnectUpcall#lostConnection(SendPort,
  * ReceivePortIdentifier, Throwable)} upcall is invoked.
  * This upcall is completely asynchronous, but Ibis ensures that 
  * at most one is alive at any given time.
  * A receiveport can forcibly close the connection,
  * in which case any communication from the sendport
  * will cause a lostConnection upcall. 
  * <strong>
  * The user may not assume that the mere fact that a
  * receive port forcibly closes its connections causes a lostConnection
  * call on the send port side.
  * The send port has to do communication to detect that there is trouble.
  * </strong>
  * 
  * If no {@link SendPortDisconnectUpcall} is registered, the user is NOT
  * informed of connections that are lost.
  * If the port supports connection downcalls, the user can
  * use the {@link #lostConnections()} method to poll for connections 
  * that are lost.
  * Again, the send port has to do communication to detect that there may be
  * trouble.
  *
  * Connections are unrelated to messages! If the sending of a message 
  * did not generate an exception, this does not mean that it actually 
  * arrived at the receive port. There may still be data in Ibis or 
  * operating system buffers, or in the network itself. 
  *
  * For a given sendport, only one message is alive at any time.
  * This is done to prevent flow control problems.  When a
  * message is alive, and a new message is requested, the request
  * blocks until the live message is finished.
  *
  * The following {@link Manageable} items are recognized:
  * <br>
  * "Messages"  the number of messages sent;
  * <br>
  * "MessageBytes" the number of bytes sent in messages (multicasts are counted
  * once);
  * <br>
  * "Bytes" the total number of bytes sent;
  * <br>
  * "Connections" the total number of connections made with this port;
  * <br>
  * "LostConnections" the number of lost connections;
  * <br>
  * "ClosedConnections" the number of closed or disconnected connections;
  *
  * Other items may be recognized, depending on the Ibis implementation.
