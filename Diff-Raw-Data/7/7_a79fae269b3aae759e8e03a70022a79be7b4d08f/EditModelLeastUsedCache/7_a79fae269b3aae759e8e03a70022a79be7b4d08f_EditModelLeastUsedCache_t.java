  * costly, especially if operations and/or post operations have a need to reload the same edit model repeatedly.
  * This will allow those repeatedly used edit models to be cached, thereby improving performance.  By design, the
  * edit models load resources and these resources are stored in memory, so we don't want to cache every edit
  * model accessed, so this is a least used cache mechanism, where the max size is 10.  If an edit model is used
  * it is put to the back of the stack, and new edit models accessed are put to the back of the stack, so that the
  * top of the stack is the first edit model disposed when the cache is higher than the threshhold.
