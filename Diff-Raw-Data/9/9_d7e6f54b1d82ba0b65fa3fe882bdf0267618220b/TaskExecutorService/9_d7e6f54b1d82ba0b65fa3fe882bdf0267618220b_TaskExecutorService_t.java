 /**
  * Defines a {@link TaskExecutor} with additional methods to better manage
  * submitted tasks. This interface is a replacement for the
  * {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} interface in java.
  * <P>
  * The {@link TaskExecutorService} provides new {@code submit} methods to submit
  * a task for execution and track its current phase of execution (as defined by
  * {@link TaskState}).
  * <P>
  * In general, {@code TaskExecutorService} implementations must be shutted down
  * once no longer needed, so that implementations may terminate their internal
  * threads. When a {@code TaskExecutorService} is shutted down it will no longer
  * accept submitting tasks and as a consequence, it will immediately execute the
  * associated cleanup task (if there is any). Note that when shutted down,
  * implementations are allowed to execute the cleanup methods (and it is very
  * likely, that they will) directly in one of the {@code submit} or
  * {@code execute} methods.
  * <P>
  * {@code TaskExecutorService} defines two ways for shutting down itself:
  * One is the {@link #shutdown() shutdown()} method and the other is the
  * {@link #shutdownAndCancel() shutdownAndCancel()} method. The difference
  * between them is that while {@code shutdown()} only prevents submitting
  * subsequent tasks, {@code shutdownAndCancel()} will actively cancel already
  * submitted tasks.
  *
  * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
  * Implementations of this interface are required to be safely accessible from
  * multiple threads concurrently.
  *
  * <h4>Synchronization transparency</h4>
  * The methods of this interface are not required to be
  * <I>synchronization transparent</I> because they may execute tasks, cleanup
  * tasks, etc.
