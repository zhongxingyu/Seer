 /**
  * Defines a task which is made of multiple subtasks. Once the task is finished
  * anyone may call {@link #finishTask(Object, Throwable, boolean) finishTask}
  * to finish this {@code MultiPhaseTask}. The main advantages of this class
  * is that it offers a {@link #getFuture() future} object representing the
  * {@code MultiPhaseTask} and it can notify a listener when the
  * {@code MultiPhaseTask} terminates and no more subtasks may run anymore.
  * <P>
  * Therefore to use this class, submit subtasks by one of the
  * {@code executeSubTask} or {@code submitSubTask} methods and when finished
  * invoke the {@code finishTask} method (possibly from a subtask).
  *
  * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
  * The methods of this class are safe to use by multiple threads concurrently.
  *
  * <h4>Synchronization transparency</h4>
  * The methods of this class are not <I>synchronization transparent</I>.
  *
  * @param <ResultType> the type of the result of this task. The result can be
  *   specified to the {@code finishTask} method and later can also be retrieved
  *   by the shared {@link #getFuture() future's} get methods.
