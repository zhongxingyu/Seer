 /**
  * Defines a {@link ListenerRegistry} which allows events to be dispatched to
  * registered listeners directly.
  * <P>
  * The listeners can be notified synchronously on any thread and also be
  * provided with a single argument.
  * <P>
  * Here is a simple usage of this interface assuming {@code Runnable} to be a
  * listener:
  * <code><pre>
  * ListenerManager&lt;Runnable, Void&gt; listeners = ...;
  * listeners.registerListener(listener1);
  * listeners.registerListener(listener2);
  *
  * // ...
  *
  * // Sometimes later, dispatch the event to "listener1" and "listener2"
  * listeners.onEvent(new EventDispatcher&lt;Runnable, Void&gt;() {
  *   public void onEvent(Runnable eventListener, Void arg) {
  *     eventListener.run();
  *   }
  * }, null);
  * </pre></code>
  * The above code will call the {@code run} method of both {@code listener1} and
  * {@code listener2} in the {@code onEvent} method. Notice that the
  * {@code EventDispatcher} is always the same and as such a single static
  * instance can be created for better performance.
  *
  * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
  * Implementations of this interface are required to be safe to use by multiple
  * threads concurrently.
  *
  * <h4>Synchronization transparency</h4>
  * The {@code onEvent} method of this interface does not required to be
  * <I>synchronization transparent</I> but methods inherited from
  * {@link ListenerRegistry} are required to be
  * <I>synchronization transparent</I> as specified by {@code ListenerRegistry}.
  *
  * @param <ListenerType> the type of the event listeners can possibly be added
  *   to the container
  * @param <ArgType> the type of the argument which can be passed to event
  *   listeners by the {@code onEvent} method
  *
  * @see CopyOnTriggerListenerManager

      * Invokes the {@link EventDispatcher#onEvent(Object, Object) onEvent}
      * method of the specified {@code EventDispatcher} with the currently
      * registered listeners and the argument specified. The {@code onEvent}
      * method is called synchronously in the current thread.
      * <P>
      * Adding new listeners to this container will have no effect on the
     * current call and the listeners being notified. That is, if a notified
     * listener adds a new listener to this container, the newly added listener
     * will not be notified in this call, only in subsequent {@code onEvent}
     * calls.
      * <P>
      * The order in which the listener are notified is undefined. Also note,
      * that multiply added listener might be notified multiple times depending
      * on the exact implementation.
      * <P>
      * Note that usually it is required that event listeners be invoked in the
      * order the events occur. This can easily be done when events can only
      * occur on single thread (as they do in Swing). However, when events can
      * occur on multiple threads concurrently they are likely to occur while
      * holding a lock and listeners should be notified right away to be notified
      * of the event to keep the order of events. Note that calling an event
      * handler method while holding a lock is prone to dead-lock (and it is very
      * likely to be possible since it is hard to reason about what listeners
      * might do). In this case you should consider using a
      * {@link org.jtrim.concurrent.TaskScheduler TaskScheduler} to invoke the
      * {@code onEvent} method.
      *
      * @param eventDispatcher the {@code EventDispatcher} whose {@code onEvent}
      *   method is to be called for every registered listener with the specified
      *   argument. The {@code onEvent} method will be called as many times as
      *   many currently registered listeners are (i.e.: the number the
      *   {@link #getListenerCount() getListenerCount()} method returns). This
      *   argument cannot be {@code null}.
      * @param arg the argument to be passed to every invocation of the
      *   {@code onEvent} method of the specified {@code EventDispatcher}. This
      *   argument can be {@code null} if the {@code EventDispatcher} allows for
      *   {@code null} arguments.
      *
      * @throws NullPointerException thrown if the specified
      *   {@code EventDispatcher} is {@code null}
