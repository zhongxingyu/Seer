 /**
  * A receiveport maintains connections to one or more sendports.
  *
  * When creating a receiveport, it is possible to pass a
  * {@link ReceivePortConnectUpcall} object. Ibis will call the
  * {@link ReceivePortConnectUpcall#gotConnection(ReceivePort,
  * SendPortIdentifier)} upcall
  * of this object when a sendport tries to initiate a new 
  * connection to the receiveport.  When a connection is lost 
  * for some reason (normal close or link error), the 
  * {@link ReceivePortConnectUpcall#lostConnection(ReceivePort,
  * SendPortIdentifier, Exception)}
  * upcall is performed. Both upcalls are completely
  * asynchronous, but Ibis ensures that at most one is active at any given
  * time.
  *
  * If no {@link ReceivePortConnectUpcall} is registered, the user is NOT
  * informed of connections that are created or lost.
  * No exceptions are thrown by the read message when a connection is lost.
  * It is the user's own responsibility to use the {@link #lostConnections()}
  * method to poll for connections that are lost.  The {@link #newConnections()}
  * method can be used to find out about new connections.
  *
  * Only one upcall is alive at a one time, this includes BOTH
  * normal (message) upcalls AND ConnectUpcalls.
  *
  * Only one message is alive at one time for a given
  * receiveport. This is done to prevent flow control problems.
  * A receiveport can be configured to generate upcalls or to 
  * support blocking receive, but NOT both!  The message object
  * is always destroyed when the upcall is finished; it is thus 
  * not correct to put it in a global variable / queue.
