 /**
  * Describes the interface for upcall based communication.
  * Creating a {@link ReceivePort} with a <code>MessageUpcall</code> allows for
  * upcall based communication.
  * The <code>ReceivePort</code> must be created with the
  * {@link Ibis#createReceivePort(PortType, String, MessageUpcall)} method,
  * or one of its other variants with a <code>MessageUpcall</code> parameter.
  * After the receive port is created, upcalls can be enabled through the
  * {@link ReceivePort#enableMessageUpcalls()} call, and disabled through the
  * {@link ReceivePort#disableMessageUpcalls()} call. Initially, upcalls are
  * disabled.
  * <p>
  * For a given receive port, only one message can be active at any time,
  * and by default, the message is active as long as the upcall is active. 
  * However, the message can be de-activated using the
  * {@link ReadMessage#finish()} call. This is the only way in which
  * a receive port can have more than one active upcall.
  * </p>
  * <p>
  * <strong>Note: to prevent deadlocks, upcalls are not allowed to block
  * in condition synchronization or network access as long as the message is
  * active.
  * </strong>
  * However, upcalls <strong>are</strong> allowed to enter/exit
  * synchronized methods for critical section operations.
  * </p>
