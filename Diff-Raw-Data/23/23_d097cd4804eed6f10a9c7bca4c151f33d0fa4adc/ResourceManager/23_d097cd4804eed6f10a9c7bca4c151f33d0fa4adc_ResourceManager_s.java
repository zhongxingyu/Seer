  * failure reporting is done using two pieces, exceptions and boolean 
  * return values.  Exceptions are used for systemy things. Return
  * values are used for operations that would affect the consistency
  * 
  * If there is a boolean return value and you're not sure how it 
  * would be used in your implementation, ignore it.  I used boolean
  * return values in the interface generously to allow flexibility in 
  * implementation.  But don't forget to return true when the operation
  * has succeeded.
