 /**
  * Defines the value of an arbitrary property. The value of this property might
  * change in an implementation dependent way. Some property might be changed by
  * client code, some might change due to external (and uncontrollable) events.
  * <P>
  * For example, the value of the property can be derived from the content of a
  * file and might get updated after the content of that file changes.
  * <P>
  * <B>Concurrency warning</B>: Although reading the properties is defined to be
  * "thread-safe", reading a single property concurrently is dangerous, unless
  * the two threads are completely independent of each other. For example,
  * consider the following scenario: Two threads read the same property and
  * they overwrite each other's result. See the following example code
  * <P>
  * <pre>
  * PropertySource&lt;Boolean&gt; property = ...;
  *
  *
  * Thread1:
  *   if (property.getValue()) {
  *     x = 1;
  *   }
  *
  * Thread2:
  *   if (!property.getValue()) {
  *     x = 2;
  *   }
  * </pre>
  * You might expect in the above code, that if {@code property.getValue()}
 * becomes and remain {@code true}, {@code x} will eventually be 1. However,
  * this is not the case because if the property was {@code false} before,
  * Thread2 might have already noticed it to be {@code false}, if after this the
  * property is quickly set to {@code true} and Thread1 also completes quickly,
  * Thread2 might continue after them setting {@code x} to 2.
  * <P>
  * To avoid the above problem, you may read the property value from a
  * {@link #addChangeListener(Runnable) change listener} because the listeners
  * may not be called concurrently, so reads won't be concurrent.
  *
  * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
  * Instances of this interface are required to be completely thread-safe
  * without any further synchronization.

      * <P>
      * Once a listener is notified, it needs to get the current value of this
      * property by calling the {@link #getValue() getValue()} method. Note that,
      * it is allowed for implementations to notify the listener even if the
      * property does not change. Also, implementations may merge listener

      * That is, listeners registered to a particular {@code PropertySource}
      * are not allowed to run concurrently with each other. This maybe achieved
      * in several ways: For example, {@link MutableProperty} does not allow its
      * {@link MutableProperty#setValue(Object) setValue} method to be called
      * concurrently (in general) and if (as usual) it notified listeners in the
      * {@code setValue} method, the listeners won't be notified concurrently.
      * That is, if they area, then the client code is at fault for calling
      * {@code setValue} concurrently.

      *   whenever the value of this property changes. This argument cannot be
      *   {@code null}.
      * @return the {@code ListenerRef} which can be used to unregister the
      *   currently added listener, so that it will no longer be notified of
      *   subsequent changes. This method may never return {@code null}.
