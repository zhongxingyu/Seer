 /**
  * This is the base interface for all Validators. A Validator is a class which verifies that objects
  * follow some rules. For example, in a MOF model which represents an EJB jar, the EJB specification
  * determines the rules. <br>
  * <br>
  * A validator can perform full validation or incremental validation. All validators must implement
  * full validation but incremental validation is optional. <br>
  * <br>
  * Each validator must not be tied to any particular workbench implementation. <br>
  * <br>
  * A validator's verification starts when the ValidatorLauncher singleton calls
  * <code>validate</code>.
  * 
 * [issue : CS - I'd like request a public API on some singleton (perhaps the plugin) to access
 * a validator registery to retrieve a particular validator registered by for a particular 'id' or 'content type'
 * Currently we're using some internals to achieve this sort of thing (as shown below).  We do this to invoke
 * validators to achieve 'as-you-type' validation in our source editors.   
 * 
 *     //Get the validator:
 *     ValidatorMetaData validatorData = ValidationRegistryReader.getReader().getValidatorMetaData(VALIDATOR_CLASS);
 *     return validatorData.getValidator();
  * ]

 	 * the running validation 'Job'.  Then the framework could automatically say something like 'XYZ validator : cleanup'.

 	 * array, then a full validation should be performed. Otherwise, validation on just the files
 	 * listed in the array should performed if the validator supports incremental validation.
 	 * 
 	 * [issue : CS - I'm curious to understand why the validator is not invoked directly on a file.  It seems it should be the
 	 * domain of another API to manage manage incremental file changes and triggering validations accordingly. 
 	 * Do we have a current use case in WTP where the validator does anything more validate a file from the changedFiles list?]
