 /**
  * Defines an executor which forwards task to a given executor and executes
  * tasks without running them concurrently. The tasks will be executed in the
  * order the they were submitted to the {@link #execute(Runnable) execute}
  * method. Subsequent tasks trying to be executed while another one scheduled to
  * this executor is running will be queued and be executed when the running task
  * terminates. Note that even if a tasks schedules a task to this executor, the
  * scheduled task will only be called after the scheduling task terminate.
  * See the following code for clarification:
  * <PRE>
  * class PrintTask implements Runnable {
  *   private final String message;
  *
  *   public PrintTask(String message) {
  *     this.message = message;
  *   }
  *
  *   public void run() {
  *     System.out.print(message);
  *   }
  * }
  *
  * void doPrint() {
  *   final InOrderExecutor executor = ...;
  *   executor.execute(new Runnable() {
  *     public void run() {
  *       System.out.print("1");
  *       executor.execute(new PrintTask("3"));
  *       System.out.print("2");
  *     }
  *   });
  * }
  * </PRE>
  * The {@code doPrint()} method will always print "123", regardless what the
  * underlying executor is.
  * <P>
  * This executor is useful to call tasks whose are not safe to be called
  * concurrently. This executor will effectively serialize the calls as if
  * all the tasks were executed by a single thread even if the underlying
  * executor uses multiple threads to execute tasks.
  * <P>
  * Note that this implementation does not expect the tasks to be
  * <I>synchronization transparent</I> but of course, they cannot wait for each
  * other. If a tasks executed by this executor submits a task to this same
  * executor and waits for this newly submitted tasks, it will dead-lock always.
  * This is because no other tasks may run concurrently with the already running
  * tasks and therefore the newly submitted task has no chance to start.
  * <P>
  * <B>Warning</B>: Instances of this class use an internal queue for tasks
  * yet to be executed and if tasks are submitted to executor faster than it
  * can actually execute it will eventually cause the internal buffer to overflow
  * and throw an {@link OutOfMemoryError}. This can occur even if the underlying
  * executor does not execute tasks scheduled to them because tasks will be
  * queued immediately by the {@code execute} method before actually executing
  * the task.
  *
  * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
  * The methods of this class are safe to use by multiple threads concurrently.
  *
  * <h4>Synchronization transparency</h4>
 * The methods of this class are not <I>synchronization transparent</I>.
