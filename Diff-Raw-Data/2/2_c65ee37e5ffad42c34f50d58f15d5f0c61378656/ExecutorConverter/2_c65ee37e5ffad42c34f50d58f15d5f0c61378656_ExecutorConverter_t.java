 /**
  * Defines static method to convert between the executors of <I>JTrim</I> and
  * the executors of <I>Java</I>. That is, conversion between
  * {@code ExecutorService} and {@link TaskExecutorService}; and conversion
  * between {@code Executor} and {@link TaskExecutor}.
  * <P>
  * Note that these conversions have limitations and may not provide all the
  * features required for the particular interface. The converter methods
  * document these limitations.
  * <P>
 * For convenience, converting executors back and forth does not endlessly wrap
  * the executors. That is, wrapping and then unwrapping an executor will yield
  * the exact same executor.
