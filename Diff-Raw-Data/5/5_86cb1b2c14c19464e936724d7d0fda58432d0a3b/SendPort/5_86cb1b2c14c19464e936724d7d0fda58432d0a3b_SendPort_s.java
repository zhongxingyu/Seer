  * Maintains connections to one or more receive ports.

  * When a connection is lost for some reason (normal close or 
  * link error), the 
  * {@link SendPortConnectUpcall#lostConnection(SendPort,
  * ReceivePortIdentifier, Exception)} upcall is invoked.
  * This upcall is completely asynchronous, but Ibis ensures that 
  * at most one is alive at any given time.
  *
  * If no {@link SendPortConnectUpcall} is registered, the user is NOT informed 
  * of connections that are lost. No exceptions are thrown by 
  * the write message. It is then the user's own responisbility 
  * to use the {@link #lostConnections()} method to poll for connections 
  * that are lost.
  *
  * Connections are unrelated to messages! If the sending of a message 
  * did not generate an exception, this does not mean that it actually 
  * arrived at the receive port. There may still be data in Ibis or 
  * operating system buffers, or in the network itself. 
  *
  * For a given sendport, only one message is alive at any time.
  * This is done to prevent flow control problems.  When a
  * message is alive, and a new message is requested, the request is
  * blocked until the live message is finished.
