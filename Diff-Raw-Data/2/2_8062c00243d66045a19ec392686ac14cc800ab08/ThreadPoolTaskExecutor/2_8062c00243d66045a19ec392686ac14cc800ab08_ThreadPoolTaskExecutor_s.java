 /**
  * A {@link TaskExecutorService} implementation which executes submitted tasks
  * on a group of threads. This implementation is similar to the
  * {@code java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor} in Java but implements
  * {@code TaskExecutorService} instead of {@code ExecutorService}.
  *
  * <h3>Executing new tasks</h3>
  * Tasks can be submitted by one of the {@code submit} or {@code execute}
  * methods.
  * <P>
  * When a new task is submitted, {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor} and there is an
  * idle thread waiting for tasks to be executed, an attempt will be made to
  * execute the submitted task on an idle thread and no new thread will be
  * started. This attempt fails only rarely under extreme contention.
  * <P>
  * In case there is no idle thread waiting and a new thread can be started
  * without exceeding the maximum number of allowed threads, a new thread will be
  * started to execute the submitted task.
  * <P>
  * In case there is no idle thread waiting and there already as many threads
  * executing tasks as allowed, the submitted task will be added to an internal
  * queue from which the background threads will eventually remove and execute
  * them. Note that the size of the queue can be limited and if this limit is
  * reached, the submitting {@code submit} or {@code execute} method will block
  * and wait until the task can be added to the queue.
  *
  * <h3>Cancellation of tasks</h3>
  * Canceling a task which was not yet started and is still in the queue will
  * immediately remove it from the queue unless it has a cleanup task associated
  * with it. If it has an associated cleanup task, its cleanup task will remain
  * in the queue to be executed but the the task itself will be canceled (and its
  * state will signal {@link TaskState#DONE_CANCELED}) and no references will be
  * retained to the task (allowing it to be garbage collected if not referenced
  * by external code).
  * <P>
  * Canceling a task will cause the {@link CancellationToken} passed to it,
  * signal cancellation request. In this case the task may decide if it is to be
  * canceled or not. If the task throws an {@link OperationCanceledException},
  * the state of the task will be {@link TaskState#DONE_CANCELED}. Note that if
  * the task throws an {@code OperationCanceledException} it is always assumed to
  * be canceled, even if the {@code CancellationToken} does not signal a
  * cancellation request.
  *
  * <h3>Number of referenced tasks</h3>
  * The maximum number of tasks referenced by a {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor}
  * at any given time is the maximum size of its queue plus the maximum number of
  * allowed threads. The {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor} will never reference
  * tasks more than this. Note however, that not yet returned {@code submit}
  * or {@code execute} methods always reference their task specified in their
  * argument (obviously this is unavoidable) and there is no limit on how many
  * times the user can concurrently call these methods.
  *
  * <h3>Terminating {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor}</h3>
  * The {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor} must always be shutted down when no longer
  * needed, so that it may shutdown its threads. If the user fails to shutdown
  * the {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor} (either by calling {@link #shutdown()} or
  * {@link #shutdownAndCancel()}) and the garbage collector notifies the
  * {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor} that it has become unreachable (through
  * finalizers), it will be logged as an error using the logging facility of Java
  * (in a {@code Level.SEVERE} log message).
  * <P>
  * The {@link TaskExecutorService} requires every implementation to execute
  * cleanup tasks in every case. Therefore this must be done even after, the
  * {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor} has terminated. If a task is submitted after
  * the {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor} has shutted down, the submitted task will
  * not be executed but its cleanup task will be executed normally as if it was
  * submitted before shutdown with a no-op task. Apart this, the main difference
  * is between submitting tasks prior and after termination is that, started
  * thread will never go idle. They will always terminate immediately after there
  * are no cleanup tasks for them to execute.
